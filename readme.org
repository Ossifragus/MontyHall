#+TITLE: Monty Hall Problem Simulation


Codes for UConn PoM on <2025-03-28 Fri> on the topic: Code got slow? Maybe it's
time to try Julia.

The folder [[file:MontyHall_Pluto][MondyHall_Pluto]] contains a Pluto notebook for playing with Monty Hall
problem interactively.

To enjoy the benefit of parallel computation with multiple threads in Julia,
start Julia with the ~-t~ option. For example the following command starts Julia
with access to 10 threads:

#+begin_src sh
julia -t 10
#+end_src

#+startup: show3levels hideblocks
#+options: h:1 timestamp:nil date:nil tasks tex:t num:t toc:nil
#+options: author:nil creator:nil html-postamble:nil HTML_DOCTYPE:HTML5
#+HTML_HEAD: <base target="_blank">
